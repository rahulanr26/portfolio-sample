Sample Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website built with HTML and basic CSS. It consists of two pages:

Home: Showcases an introduction or overview.
Contact: Provides a way to reach out or connect.

The design is clean and minimal, focusing on core web development principles without any frameworks or libraries. It's an excellent starting point for beginners looking to practice structuring web pages and styling them with CSS.

Feel free to explore and let me know if you need further enhancements or a specific structure for a README file!
